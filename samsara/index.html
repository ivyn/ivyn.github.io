                <p class="text-monospace">Context</p>
                <p>The trucking industry is a powerful force that drives the U.S. economy. Businesses depend on the transportation of freight from warehouses to stores and homes.</p>
                <p>Samsara is the leader in industrial IoT. Their mission is to improve the safety, efficiency, and productivity of the operations that power our economy.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I worked with Dylan Lew, Phoebe Lin, and Zaid Syed to design turn-by-turn navigation that integrates with U.S. work hour regulation systems for Samsara's truck driver app.</p>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br>The Problem</p>
                <p>Samsara's Routes team proposed a general question: How might we improve the quality of life for long-haul truck drivers? Through user research, we narrowed the problem focus to navigation and rest stop finding. Currently, drivers use one app for turn-by-turn directions, another for timekeeping, and another for rest stop finding.</p>
                <p>Our assumption, which we later validated through user testing, was that a seamless experience would help drivers stay on track and take care of themselves on the road.</p>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br>How Might We...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><font color="#008001">navigate</font>: expand the Samsara driver app to include turn-by-turn navigation</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">find</font>: help drivers find rest stops along their routes</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">integrate</font>: allow drivers to seamlessly keep track of their hours of service</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br>User Research</p>
                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/map.png">
                <p><br>Because we were unfamiliar with the trucking industry, we did secondary research to inform ourselves and get a solid background before talking to truck drivers.</p>
                <p>Drivers operate on 4 clocks with strict penalties for violations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><font color="#008001">drive</font>: maximum of 11 hours of driving after a 10 hour break</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">break</font>: 30 minutes of rest for every 8 hours of driving</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">shift</font>: 10 hour break after driving for 14 consecutive hours</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">cycle</font>: 34 hour break after driving for 60 hours over 7 days</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This lifestyle can make it difficult for drivers to maintain their health, diet, relationships, and other areas of well-being.</p>
                <p>We went to the Samsara office in San Francisco to work with Merlyn Fraga, a senior researcher who guided us. She taught us about activities and questions that use projective techniques, which let a person respond to ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing hidden emotions and internal conflicts projected by the person onto the test.</p>
                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/arc.png">
                <p><br>For our first round of user testing, we went to the SF Oakland Truck Stop. Photos by me.</p>

                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/IMG_9728.jpg"/>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br><br>Synthesis</p>
                <p>We created categories based on how often truckers mentioned the pain points, and organized our findings under them. Points from rest stop workers are shown in dark grey cards.</p>
                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/affinity.png"/>
                <p><br>We compiled our most compelling findings into insights. We chose to design around the two categories that had the most potential for impact.</p>

                <p class="text-monospace"><br><br>Low Fidelity Prototype</p>
                <p>We brainstormed solutions around food, parking, and finding rest stops. We each fleshed out product goals and ideas based on the user needs.</p>
                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/low.png"/>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br><br>Strategic Framing and Competitive Analysis</p>
                <p>During ideation, we identified four product goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Help truckers find rest stops by communicating relevant information about food options, parking, gas, and related pricing</li>
                    <li>Integrate with ELD system to optimize travel for maximum driving time</li>
                    <li>Be accessible to drivers, who are often not tech-savvy</li>
                    <li>Offer an audio experience or simplified design while driving</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our solution is turn-by-turn navigation that displays roads accessible to 18-wheelers and a search function that allows truck drivers to find rest stops with preferred amenities along their routes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><font color="#008001">Business Incentive</font>: These features expand the Samsara ecosystem to make the product more desirable to fleet administrators who want to keep their truck drivers happy.</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">Market Share</font>: ELD integration with navigation is an untouched market. Currently, drivers have to use one app to keep track of their time and a separate device for trucker-specific navigation.</li>
                    <li><font color="#008001">User Impact</font>: Finding the right rest stop improves the quality of life for truck drivers who need specific amenities.</li>
                </ul>
                <img class="page-img" src="../assets/img/samsara/current.png"/>
                <p><br>Current options have a disconnect between navigation and ELD. Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze display roads that are not accessible to 18-wheelers.</p>

                <p>Thank you to Samsara Product Designers Emily White, Andrew Watterson, Bec Lai, Ishaan Kansal, and Stephen Kui for their continual feedback on our iterations. We met with them once a week, and they constantly pushed us to consider different perspectives and think through our design decisions.</p>

                <p class="text-monospace"><br><br>Engineering Constraints</p>
                <p>For these experimental features, we wanted to use existing APIs and SDKs to quickly build the features and test its business value.
                   <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/use-cases/turn-by-turn-navigation/">Mapbox</a> offers satellite views and turn-by-turn instructions.
                   The <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started">Yelp API</a> provides reviews, search results, and specific stop details.</p>
                <p class="text-monospace"><br>Usability Testing</p>
                <p>Due to COVID-19, we were unable to go to a rest stop to conduct usability testing in person. However, we were able to do a 45-minute video call with Nino M., a truck driver.</p>
